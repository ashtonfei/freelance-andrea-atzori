### Google Sheets script Developer needed to email content of the sheet when a cell is updated

### Job Details

We are looking for a Google Sheets script developer to create a script to do the following:

- when a cell is updated, for example the date in cell D9, an email is automatically sent to the recipient in cell C3
- the content of the email has to be the cell range (B7:E25)
- subject of the email must be pulled from cell C5

Our goal is to send these emails when the report is updated. This can be every day, or once per week, so please make recommendations/suggestions in regards to the trigger if you believe that there is a better way to schedule the email.

Here is the link to the test spreadsheet:

In your reply, please add "YaKKa" so that we know that you have read this brief and it's not an automated response.

Any questions please ask.
